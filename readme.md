Title: Transformers for annotationg scientific literature.
We propose to use Transformer architectures for annotating scientific papers. Our target annotations are (1) results that can be used in meta-studies (2) items
that match the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards items.
Project milestones:
* Obtain two datasets of scientific papers in fields with an empirical component
* Manually annotate a small dataset
  * Dataset II: 60-60-60
* Validate the process of extracting a particular item from a large dataset
* Perform an initial meta-study using the system
